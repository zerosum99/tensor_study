      " |  A variable maintains state in the graph across calls to `run()`. You add a\n",

      " |  \n",
      " |  The `Variable()` constructor requires an initial value for the variable,\n",
      " |  which can be a `Tensor` of any type and shape. The initial value defines the\n",
      " |  type and shape of the variable. After construction, the type and shape of\n",
      " |  the variable are fixed. The value can be changed using one of the assign\n",
      " |  methods.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  If you want to change the shape of a variable later you have to use an\n",
      " |  `assign` Op with `validate_shape=False`.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  Just like any `Tensor`, variables created with `Variable()` can be used as\n",
      " |  inputs for other Ops in the graph. Additionally, all the operators\n",
      " |  overloaded for the `Tensor` class are carried over to variables, so you can\n",
      " |  also add nodes to the graph by just doing arithmetic on variables.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  ```python\n",
      " |  import tensorflow as tf\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  # Create a variable.\n",
      " |  w = tf.Variable(<initial-value>, name=<optional-name>)\n",

      " |  simply running an `assign` Op that assigns a value to the variable. In fact,\n",
      " |  the variable *initializer op* is just an `assign` Op that assigns the\n",

      " |      # ...you now can run ops that use the value of 'w'...\n",
      " |  ```\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  The most common initialization pattern is to use the convenience function\n",
      " |  `global_variables_initializer()` to add an Op to the graph that initializes\n",
      " |  all the variables. You then run that Op after launching the graph.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  ```python\n",
      " |  # Add an Op to initialize global variables.\n",
      " |  init_op = tf.global_variables_initializer()\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  # Launch the graph in a session.\n",

      " |      # Run the Op that initializes global variables.\n",
      " |      sess.run(init_op)\n",

      " |  If you need to create a variable with an initial value dependent on another\n",
